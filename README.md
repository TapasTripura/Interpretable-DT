# Files
The main codes, described below, are standalone codes. They can be directly run. However, for the figures in the published article, one needs to run the files in the folder `Paper_figures`. A short despcription on the files are provided below for ease of readers.
  + `Example_1_BScholes.py` is the code to discover physics for the Example 1: Black-Scholes equation [article](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2208.05609.pdf).
  + `Example_2_Duffing.py` is the code to discover physics for the Example 2: Parametrically excited Duffing oscillator [article](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2208.05609.pdf).
  + `Example_3_2DOF.py` is the code to discover physics for the Example 3: 2DOF system [article](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2208.05609.pdf).
  + `Example_4_boucwen.py` is the code to discover physics for the Example 4: Bouc-Wen, with partially observed state variables [article](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2208.05609.pdf).
  - `utils_gibbs.py` is a part of gibbs sampling in section 2.2 [article](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2208.05609.pdf).
  * `utils_library.py` contains useful functions, like, library construction, data-normalization.
  + `utils_response.py` is the code to generate data using stochastic calculus.
The codes for the *Stochastic SINDy* are provided in the folder *Stochastic_Sindy*.
